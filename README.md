1. Added semantic HTML elements
2. HTML now follows logicial structure independent of styling/position
3. All image elements now have *alt* tags
4. Heading attributes are ordered
5. A concise, descriptive title was added
6. All links are functional
7. CSS selectors and properties are conoslidated 
8. README file added
